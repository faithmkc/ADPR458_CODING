                <h2>Dr. Jason Bennett</h2>
                <p>
                    Dr. Jason is our lead chiropractor and wellness wizard. With over 15 years of experience,
                    he's passionate about helping people feel their best—naturally. He believes healing starts from the inside out
                    and works with each patient to create a customized care plan. Outside the office, you’ll catch him biking the
                    trails, sipping green smoothies, and cracking jokes (and backs).
